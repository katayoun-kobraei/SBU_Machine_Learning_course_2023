# Computer Science Faculty of Shahid Beheshti University. Winter 2023


## Description

This repository contains materials for the **Machine Learning Course** offered by the Computer Science Faculty of Shahid Beheshti University in Winter 2023.

Machine learning is a rapidly evolving field that is revolutionizing how we interact with data. This course begins with the fundamentals, including statistics and probability, before progressing to advanced topics like linear and logistic regression, classification, clustering, deep learning, and reinforcement learning. By the end of the course, students will have a solid understanding of various machine learning models and techniques, and the ability to apply them to real-world problems.
